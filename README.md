Prospective student of an institution may often find the required course prerequisite graphs of engineering and computer science programs provided alongside the curricular descriptions. The students may once again come across the course prerequiste graph required courses in their program in data structure and algorithms classses in the contrxt of DAG.
Providing there relevent course dependency networks as an example not only serves to motivate the students in the topic but also often helps them better navigate their own planning or scheduling.
Important strides in the representation and visulization of course dependency networks towards curriculum planning have paralled recent analyses of CPNs in the context of complex network.
